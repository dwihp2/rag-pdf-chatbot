# Database Connection Fix - Prepared Statement Error Resolution

## Problem
The application was experiencing a PostgreSQL error when creating new chats:
```
Error [PrismaClientUnknownRequestError]: 
Invalid `prisma.chat.create()` invocation:
Error occurred during query execution:
ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(PostgresError { code: "42P05", message: "prepared statement \"s0\" already exists", severity: "ERROR", detail: None, column: None, hint: None }), transient: false })
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by Supabase's connection pooler (pgBouncer) on port 6543, which caches prepared statements and can cause conflicts in serverless environments where connections are frequently opened and closed.

## Solution Applied
### 1. Updated Environment Variables
Changed the database connection from the pooler connection to the direct connection:

**Before:**
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://...@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require&supa=base-pooler.x"
```

**After:**
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://...@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=require"
```

### 2. Updated Prisma Schema
Changed the database URL reference from `POSTGRES_URL` to `DATABASE_URL`:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
}
```

### 3. Simplified Database Service
Removed complex connection handling and kept the database service simple and reliable:

```typescript
const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? new PrismaClient({
  log: ['warn', 'error'],
});
```

## Results
- ✅ Chat creation now works successfully
- ✅ All database operations function properly
- ✅ No more prepared statement conflicts
- ✅ API endpoints respond correctly

## Testing
Created and ran database tests that confirm:
1. Database connection is successful
2. Chat creation works
3. Chat retrieval works
4. API endpoints respond correctly

## Key Takeaway
When using Supabase with Prisma in serverless environments (like Next.js), use the direct database connection (port 5432) instead of the pooler connection (port 6543) to avoid prepared statement conflicts.
